# GitCommit

Add this function to a project. Call it with GitCommit("message") 

The message is used for the commit changes to your code. 

This code checks to make sure git is installed, that there is an active local directory, and if you are connected to git with your email.

If all of these check out, then it will pull any recent changes, add all files in the staging area, commit the changes, and push to desired branch.
